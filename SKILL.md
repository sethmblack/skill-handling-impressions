# Handling Impressions (Phantasia Management)

Pause before reacting to any disturbing impression. Examine whether it concerns things within your control. Withhold assent from judgments until tested by reason.

---

## When to Use

- Experiencing strong emotional reactions (anger, fear, anxiety, frustration)
- Caught in rumination or disturbing thoughts
- Feeling like a situation is "unbearable" or "catastrophic"
- Reacting impulsively before thinking
- User says "Why am I so upset?" or "I can't stop thinking about X"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| impression | Yes | The thought, feeling, or reaction being experienced |
| trigger | Yes | What event or circumstance prompted this impression |
| intensity | No | How strong the reaction feels (1-10) |

## The Stoic Framework

Epictetus taught:

> "It is not things that disturb us, but our judgments about things."

This is the foundation of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Between stimulus and response lies a gap — the power of assent. An impression arises, but you do not have to accept it as true or act on it.

### What Is an Impression (Phantasia)?

An impression is any mental representation:
- Perceptions: "My colleague ignored me"
- Judgments: "She doesn't respect me"
- Evaluations: "This is terrible and unfair"
- Impulses: "I should confront her right now"

The first (perception) may be accurate. The second and third (judgments and evaluations) are where error creeps in. The fourth (impulse) is where we act from that error.

### The Power of Assent

Epictetus teaches that we can withhold assent from impressions:

> "Impression, wait for me a little. Let me see what you are, and what you represent."

By pausing before agreeing that an impression is true, we create space for reason.

## Analysis Steps

### Step 1: Pause
Stop before reacting. The impression is strong, but you do not have to follow it.

Say internally: "Impression, wait. Let me examine you."

### Step 2: Identify the Impression
What exactly is the thought or feeling? Name it precisely:
- "I am feeling that X is terrible"
- "I am judging that Y was wrong"
- "I am afraid that Z will happen"

Notice: "I am feeling that..." not "It is..."

### Step 3: Separate Fact from Judgment
Distinguish the neutral event from your interpretation:
- **Fact:** "My colleague walked past without saying hello"
- **Judgment:** "She is deliberately ignoring me because she's angry"

The fact is observable. The judgment is your addition.

### Step 4: Apply the Dichotomy of Control
Ask: "Does this concern something up to me, or not up to me?"
- Her feelings toward me: Not up to me
- What her action means: Not up to me
- My response and behavior: Up to me
- My judgments about the situation: Up to me

### Step 5: Test the Judgment
Before accepting the impression, test it:
- Is this necessarily true?
- What other explanations are possible?
- If true, is it as catastrophic as it feels?
- What would a wise person conclude?

### Step 6: Choose Your Response
Based on reason, not the impression:
- What action is appropriate?
- What would virtue (wisdom, justice, courage, temperance) require?
- What can you control, and what must you accept?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Impression Analysis

### The Impression
[What the person is experiencing — the thought, feeling, or reaction]

### The Trigger Event
[What prompted this impression — the neutral, observable facts]

### Separating Fact from Judgment

| What Happened (Fact) | What I'm Adding (Judgment) |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| [Observable event] | [Interpretation, evaluation, meaning-making] |

### Testing the Judgment

| Judgment | Challenge |
|----------|-----------|
| [The disturbing thought] | [Alternative explanation or reframe] |

### The Dichotomy Check
- **Up to me:** [What you can actually control]
- **Not up to me:** [What you must accept]

### Reasoned Response
[What wisdom and virtue require in this situation]

### The Stoic Reminder
> [Relevant Epictetus quote]
```

## Constraints

- Do not minimize genuine distress — the goal is clarity, not dismissiveness
- Some impressions are accurate; the skill is to test them, not automatically reject them
- Withholding assent is not suppression — the feeling is acknowledged, but the judgment is examined
- This is a practice, not a one-time fix; skill develops with repetition

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I found out my presentation got moved to next week and I'm furious. They knew I prepared for today. Now I have to redo everything and I wasted all that time."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Impression Analysis

### The Impression
Strong anger and frustration. Judgment that time was "wasted" and that others acted inconsiderately. Impulse to confront or complain.

### The Trigger Event
The presentation was rescheduled from today to next week. I had prepared for today's date.

### Separating Fact from Judgment

| What Happened (Fact) | What I'm Adding (Judgment) |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Presentation moved to next week | "They knew I prepared" (assuming intentional disregard) |
| I prepared materials for today | "I wasted all that time" (declaring the work valueless) |
| Schedule changed | "I have to redo everything" (catastrophizing the impact) |

### Testing the Judgment

| Judgment | Challenge |
|----------|-----------|
| "They knew I prepared" | Did they? Schedules change for many reasons. This may have been unavoidable or last-minute. |
| "I wasted all that time" | Is preparation wasted? The work is done — you are more prepared than before, not less. |
| "I have to redo everything" | Do you? Most preparation carries over. What specifically needs redoing? |
| "This is infuriating" | Is it? Or is it merely inconvenient? What makes it worth fury? |

### The Dichotomy Check
- **Up to me:** My response, my attitude, how I use the extra time, whether I complain or adapt
- **Not up to me:** The schedule change, others' decisions, the past preparation time

### Reasoned Response
The schedule changed — this is not up to me, so fury is misdirected. My preparation is not wasted; I am better prepared than I would be otherwise. The extra week could be used to improve the presentation, relax, or simply continue with other work.

The virtuous response: accept the change with equanimity, use the time well, communicate professionally if feedback is appropriate.

### The Stoic Reminder
> "It is not things that disturb us, but our judgments about things. Death, for example, is not terrible, or else Socrates would have thought so. What is terrible is our judgment that death is terrible."
> — Epictetus, Enchiridion 5

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Epictetus** expert persona and is foundational to Stoic practice. It directly influenced Cognitive Behavioral Therapy's ABC model (Activating event → Belief → Consequence) and is the practical application of the dichotomy of control to mental events.
