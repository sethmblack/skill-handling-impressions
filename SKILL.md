# Handling Impressions (Phantasia Management)

Pause before reacting to any disturbing impression. Examine whether it concerns things within your control. Withhold assent from judgments until tested by reason. Based on Epictetus's teaching that "it is not things that disturb us, but our judgments about things," this framework is the practical application of Stoic philosophy to everyday emotional reactions. The core insight is that between stimulus and response lies a gap - the power of assent. An impression arises (perception, judgment, impulse), but you do not have to accept it as true or act on it. This same principle underlies Cognitive Behavioral Therapy's ABC model (Activating event, Belief, Consequence) and provides a systematic method for examining and choosing your responses.

## When to Use

- Experiencing strong emotional reactions (anger, fear, anxiety, frustration)
- Caught in rumination or disturbing thoughts
- Feeling like a situation is "unbearable" or "catastrophic"
- Reacting impulsively before thinking
- User says "Why am I so upset?" or "I can't stop thinking about X"
- When emotions feel disproportionate to the triggering event

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| impression | Yes | The thought, feeling, or reaction being experienced |
| trigger | Yes | What event or circumstance prompted this impression |
| intensity | No | How strong the reaction feels (1-10) |

---

## Core Principle

Between stimulus and response lies the power of assent. An impression arises - a perception, judgment, or impulse - but you are not required to accept it as true or act upon it. "Impression, wait for me a little. Let me see what you are, and what you represent." By pausing before agreeing that an impression is true, you create space for reason. The disturbance comes not from events but from your judgments about events.

---

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Pause

1. Stop before reacting
2. The impression is strong, but you do not have to follow it
3. Say internally: "Impression, wait. Let me examine you."

### Phase 2: Identify the Impression

1. Name exactly what the thought or feeling is:
   - "I am feeling that X is terrible"
   - "I am judging that Y was wrong"
   - "I am afraid that Z will happen"
2. Notice the framing: "I am feeling that..." not "It is..."

### Phase 3: Separate Fact from Judgment

1. Distinguish the neutral, observable event from your interpretation
   - **Fact:** "My colleague walked past without saying hello"
   - **Judgment:** "She is deliberately ignoring me because she's angry"
2. The fact is observable; the judgment is your addition

### Phase 4: Apply the Dichotomy of Control

1. Ask: "Does this concern something up to me, or not up to me?"
   - Her feelings toward me: Not up to me
   - What her action means: Not up to me
   - My response and behavior: Up to me
   - My judgments about the situation: Up to me

### Phase 5: Test the Judgment

1. Before accepting the impression, test it:
   - Is this necessarily true?
   - What other explanations are possible?
   - If true, is it as catastrophic as it feels?
   - What would a wise person conclude?

### Phase 6: Choose Your Response

1. Based on reason, not the impression:
   - What action is appropriate?
   - What would virtue (wisdom, justice, courage, temperance) require?
   - What can you control, and what must you accept?

```markdown
## Impression Analysis

### The Impression
[What the person is experiencing - the thought, feeling, or reaction]

### The Trigger Event
[What prompted this impression - the neutral, observable facts]

### Separating Fact from Judgment

| What Happened (Fact) | What I'm Adding (Judgment) |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| [Observable event] | [Interpretation, evaluation, meaning-making] |

### Testing the Judgment

| Judgment | Challenge |
|----------|-----------|
| [The disturbing thought] | [Alternative explanation or reframe] |

### The Dichotomy Check
- **Up to me:** [What you can actually control]
- **Not up to me:** [What you must accept]

### Reasoned Response
[What wisdom and virtue require in this situation]

### The Stoic Reminder
> [Relevant Epictetus quote]

## Constraints

- Do not minimize genuine distress - the goal is clarity, not dismissiveness
- Some impressions are accurate - the skill is to test them, not automatically reject them
- Withholding assent is not suppression - the feeling is acknowledged, but the judgment is examined
- This is a practice, not a one-time fix - skill develops with repetition
- Do not use this to invalidate legitimate emotions about genuine wrongs
- Recognize that some situations require action, not just reframing

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|--------------|--------------|
| Using Stoicism to suppress emotions | The goal is examination, not suppression; feelings are acknowledged, judgments are tested |
| Invalidating legitimate concerns | Some impressions are accurate; the point is to test, not automatically dismiss |
| Treating this as one-time fix | Impression management is a practice developed over time, not a technique applied once |
| Passivity in face of injustice | Stoicism is about controlling response, not accepting all circumstances; action may be required |
| Intellectualizing without feeling | The analysis must include acknowledgment of the emotion, not bypass it |

## Examples

### Example 1: Rescheduled Presentation

**Situation:** "I found out my presentation got moved to next week and I'm furious. They knew I prepared for today. Now I have to redo everything and I wasted all that time."

**Application:**

**The Impression:** Strong anger and frustration. Judgment that time was "wasted" and that others acted inconsiderately. Impulse to confront or complain.

**The Trigger Event:** The presentation was rescheduled from today to next week. I had prepared for today's date.

**Separating Fact from Judgment:**

| What Happened (Fact) | What I'm Adding (Judgment) |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Presentation moved to next week | "They knew I prepared" (assuming intentional disregard) |
| I prepared materials for today | "I wasted all that time" (declaring the work valueless) |
| Schedule changed | "I have to redo everything" (catastrophizing the impact) |

**Testing the Judgment:**

| Judgment | Challenge |
|----------|-----------|
| "They knew I prepared" | Did they? Schedules change for many reasons. This may have been unavoidable. |
| "I wasted all that time" | Is preparation wasted? The work is done - you are more prepared, not less. |
| "I have to redo everything" | Do you? Most preparation carries over. What specifically needs redoing? |

**The Dichotomy Check:**
- **Up to me:** My response, my attitude, how I use the extra time, whether I complain or adapt
- **Not up to me:** The schedule change, others' decisions, the past preparation time

**Reasoned Response:** The schedule changed - this is not up to me, so fury is misdirected. My preparation is not wasted. The extra week could improve the presentation. The virtuous response: accept with equanimity, use the time well, communicate professionally if feedback is appropriate.

### Example 2: Social Rejection

**Situation:** "I invited a friend to lunch and they said they were busy, but I saw on social media they went to lunch with someone else. I feel betrayed and worthless."

**Application:**

**Separating Fact from Judgment:**

| What Happened (Fact) | What I'm Adding (Judgment) |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Friend declined my invitation | "They lied to me" |
| Friend had lunch with someone else | "They prefer others to me" |
| I feel hurt | "I am worthless" |

**Testing the Judgment:**

| Judgment | Challenge |
|----------|-----------|
| "They lied" | Did they? They may have had a conflict with my timing but not with the other person's. |
| "They prefer others" | One lunch choice says nothing about overall preference. |
| "I am worthless" | This is a giant leap from one declined invitation. |

**The Dichotomy Check:**
- **Up to me:** Whether I ask for clarity, how I interpret this, whether I maintain the friendship
- **Not up to me:** Their choices, their feelings, their schedule

**Reasoned Response:** The facts support hurt feelings but not the judgment of worthlessness. If the pattern concerns me, I can ask directly rather than spiral. One lunch is not a referendum on my value.

**The Stoic Reminder:**
> "It is not things that disturb us, but our judgments about things."

- Emotional regulation techniques

**When to prefer this skill:**
- When emotional reactions feel disproportionate to events
- When caught in rumination or catastrophic thinking
